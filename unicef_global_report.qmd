# Introduction {#introduction}

Access to **education** and **hygiene** are fundamental to improving the health, development, and opportunities of children worldwide. These two factors play a central role in shaping the future of children, influencing their physical health, mental well-being, and potential for success in life. However, these opportunities are not equally distributed across the globe. 

This report uses global data provided by **UNICEF** to explore the current state of education and hygiene access in different countries. By visualizing these patterns, we aim to highlight the disparities that exist and call for action to improve these essential services, especially in developing regions. The data analyzed focuses on:

- **Adolescent School Attendance**: The proportion of adolescents attending school across countries, revealing gaps in education.
- **Access to Basic Hygiene Facilities**: The availability of essential sanitation infrastructure such as handwashing facilities, which directly affect children’s health.
- **Economic and Health Indicators**: Information that connects economic prosperity with the state of education and hygiene access.

This analysis will help provide valuable insights into the global progress and challenges in these critical areas and inform policy-making. We visualize trends over time, highlighting which countries are performing well and which ones need immediate attention.

## Data Overview 

The analysis is based on the following three primary datasets from **UNICEF** and other global sources:

1. **Indicator 1: Adolescent Attendance Rate** (`unicef_indicator_1.csv`)
   - This dataset contains information on the school attendance rate for adolescents (ages 15-19) across different countries, segmented by gender (Total, Male, Female). It includes data over several years, providing insights into how adolescent education access has evolved over time. 
   - **Key Variables**:
     - `country`: Name of the country.
     - `time_period`: The year of the observation.
     - `sex`: Gender category (Total, Male, Female).
     - `obs_value`: The attendance rate as a percentage of adolescents attending school.

2. **Indicator 2: Hygiene Access** (`unicef_indicator_2.csv`)
   - This dataset tracks the percentage of the population in each country lacking access to basic hygiene facilities, such as handwashing facilities with soap and water. Poor hygiene is closely linked to child mortality rates and overall public health.
   - **Key Variables**:
     - `country`: Name of the country.
     - `time_period`: The year of the observation.
     - `sex`: Gender category (Total, Male, Female).
     - `obs_value`: The percentage of the population with no access to handwashing facilities.

3. **Metadata: Country-Level Information** (`unicef_metadata.csv`)
   - This dataset provides key economic and demographic information about each country, including **GDP per capita** and general health statistics. It allows us to correlate economic prosperity with access to education and hygiene facilities, providing a more comprehensive view of the global situation.
   - **Key Variables**:
     - `country`: Name of the country.
     - `GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)`: Economic measure showing the GDP per capita, adjusted for inflation.
     - Additional demographic and health-related variables that can be merged with the other datasets.

By analyzing these datasets, we can identify patterns and trends that reflect the relationship between education, hygiene, and economic development, thus contributing to a broader understanding of global child development issues.

We now proceed to explore the data visually, starting with a world map that showcases global adolescent school attendance rates.

# 1. World Map: Global Adolescent School Attendance Rate {#world-map}

Access to education is a fundamental human right and one of the most critical factors in determining the development and future prospects of children. The **adolescent school attendance rate** is an important indicator of educational access and quality. High attendance rates indicate a country’s investment in education and a commitment to ensuring children and adolescents can access learning opportunities. Conversely, low attendance rates often reflect systemic barriers such as poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and gender inequality.

This world map provides a **global overview of adolescent school attendance rates**, showcasing the disparities in educational access between countries. It visualizes the percentage of adolescents (ages 15-19) attending school across the globe, with color coding to represent the varying rates of school attendance.

### Insights from the Map:
- **High Attendance Countries**: Countries such as those in Northern and Western Europe (e.g., Finland, Denmark, and Germany) typically show high school attendance rates, reflecting their strong educational systems and infrastructure.
- **Low Attendance Countries**: Some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (e.g., Niger, Chad, and Afghanistan) exhibit very low attendance rates. This can be attributed to factors like political instability, insufficient educational resources, poverty, and cultural barriers to education, particularly for girls.
- **Regional Variations**: The map highlights significant regional differences. While many high-income countries have near-universal attendance rates, developing nations face ongoing challenges in achieving universal education.
- **Missing Data**: Some countries may show areas shaded in **light grey**, indicating **missing data**. This is common in regions where data collection might be limited due to conflict or logistical challenges, making it difficult to assess educational access accurately.

### Data Representation:
- The map uses **color gradients** (e.g., blues or cool tones) to visually depict the attendance rate. Darker colors indicate **higher attendance rates**, while lighter colors reflect **lower attendance rates**.
- The map's visual representation allows for an immediate understanding of where countries stand in terms of adolescent education, providing a tool for identifying regions where international efforts to improve education could be most beneficial.

The data for this map comes from UNICEF’s global education statistics, focusing on the **adolescent school attendance rate**, which reflects how well countries are educating their youth. This is a crucial metric for determining the **human capital** available to a nation in the future, as educated adolescents are more likely to contribute positively to their economies and societies.

By analyzing this map, policymakers, educators, and global organizations can better understand the **global educational landscape** and where interventions are most needed to improve educational access and quality for all children and adolescents.

# 2. Bar Chart: Countries with Lowest Hygiene Access {#bar-chart}

Access to basic hygiene facilities is a cornerstone of public health, particularly in the fight against preventable diseases such as diarrheal infections, respiratory diseases, and other sanitation-related illnesses. The ability to wash hands with soap and water is one of the simplest and most effective ways to prevent the spread of diseases, yet millions of people worldwide still lack access to such basic sanitation services. 

This bar chart visualizes the **countries with the lowest access to hygiene facilities**, specifically focusing on the **percentage of the population that has no access to handwashing facilities**. The data is based on the most recent available statistics from UNICEF and provides a stark representation of the disparities in hygiene access across the globe.

### Key Insights from the Bar Chart:
- **Top 10 Countries with the Lowest Access**: The chart highlights the ten countries where a significant portion of the population lacks access to basic hygiene facilities. These countries are often grappling with issues such as **poverty**, **insufficient infrastructure**, **political instability**, and **rural-urban divides** that hinder the provision of clean water and sanitation facilities.
  
- **Regional Patterns**: Many of the countries with the lowest access to hygiene facilities are found in **Sub-Saharan Africa** and **South Asia**, such as **Ethiopia**, **India**, and **Nigeria**. This reflects ongoing challenges in these regions to provide adequate sanitation infrastructure to rapidly growing populations.
  
- **Disparities by Income Level**: The chart also highlights the stark contrast between high-income and low-income countries in terms of hygiene access. In developed nations, the vast majority of the population has reliable access to hygiene facilities, whereas in low-income nations, millions of people still lack this basic service.

### Data Representation:
- The **bar chart** uses a **horizontal layout**, with the countries listed on the y-axis and the percentage of the population lacking access to hygiene facilities on the x-axis.
- **Coloring**: Each bar is colored in **tomato red**, drawing attention to the critical nature of the issue. The chart presents the data in a **descending order**, with the **longest bars representing countries with the most significant gaps** in hygiene access.
- **Reordering**: The bars are reordered to ensure that the countries with the lowest access to hygiene are placed at the top, making it easy to identify the most pressing areas for intervention.

# 3. Scatter Plot: Hygiene Access vs GDP per Capita {#scatter-plot}

The relationship between **hygiene access** and **economic prosperity** is a critical one. Access to basic sanitation and hygiene facilities—such as clean water, handwashing stations, and sewage systems—is not only a fundamental human right but also a crucial determinant of public health. As countries experience economic growth, the ability to invest in public infrastructure, including sanitation, increases, leading to better health outcomes for their populations.

This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the **percentage of the population lacking access to hygiene facilities** and **GDP per capita (adjusted for inflation)** across different countries. By examining this relationship, we aim to understand how economic development correlates with improvements in hygiene access, and to explore whether wealthier countries tend to provide better sanitation services for their populations.

### Key Insights from the Scatter Plot:
- **Positive Correlation**: In general, we expect to see a **negative correlation** between GDP per capita and the percentage of the population lacking access to hygiene facilities. Wealthier countries are often able to invest more in public services like sanitation infrastructure, which results in lower percentages of people without access to hygiene facilities. In contrast, lower-income countries may struggle to provide adequate sanitation due to resource constraints.
  
- **Outliers**: Some countries might appear as outliers in the scatter plot, deviating from the general trend. These countries may have high GDP per capita but still show relatively low hygiene access. Such anomalies can be explained by factors other than income, such as political instability, corruption, or inefficient resource allocation. For example, some high-income countries might still face challenges in specific regions or among particular populations that lack access to sanitation.
  
- **Regional Clusters**: The scatter plot may also reveal regional patterns. For instance, **developed countries** in North America, Western Europe, and East Asia are generally positioned in the upper-right quadrant, showing both high GDP and low percentages of people lacking access to hygiene. Conversely, many **developing countries** in Africa and South Asia are positioned in the lower-left quadrant, indicating low GDP and high percentages of people without access to hygiene.

### Data Representation:
- The **x-axis** represents **GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)**, which is a measure of the economic output per person in a given country. It is presented on a **logarithmic scale** to better capture the wide range of economic disparities between countries.
- The **y-axis** represents the **percentage of the population with no access to hygiene facilities**, with higher values indicating greater deprivation in sanitation.
- Each point on the scatter plot represents a **country**, with the data points color-coded according to the country’s **region** or **income level** to help identify clusters and regional trends.
- A **linear regression line** (black line) is added to highlight the general trend between GDP per capita and hygiene access. The slope of the line provides insight into the strength of the relationship between these two variables. A **negative slope** would reinforce the hypothesis that higher GDP per capita is associated with better access to hygiene.

### Insights and Significance:
- **Economic Prosperity and Hygiene Access**: The scatter plot reinforces the understanding that **wealthier countries** are more likely to have the financial resources to invest in sanitation infrastructure, leading to better access to hygiene facilities for their populations. However, this relationship is not always straightforward, as economic prosperity alone is not a guarantee of equitable access to basic sanitation.
  
- **Global Disparities**: The scatter plot also visually demonstrates the **global disparities** in both economic development and hygiene access. While high-income countries generally provide access to hygiene, there are still significant gaps in middle- and low-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, and Latin America. These disparities emphasize the importance of targeted investments in infrastructure and health in the regions most in need.
  
- **Policy Implications**: For policymakers, the scatter plot serves as a reminder that economic growth must be inclusive. Simply achieving high GDP per capita is not enough if it does not translate into improved living conditions for all citizens. Investments in public health infrastructure, such as sanitation and hygiene, are necessary to reduce disparities in access to basic services.

### Limitations of the Analysis:
While this scatter plot provides valuable insights, it is important to note the limitations:
- **Outliers**: Some countries may not follow the expected trend due to factors other than income, such as corruption, political instability, or lack of efficient resource allocation.
- **Data Gaps**: There may be some missing or incomplete data for certain countries, which can skew the results or limit the interpretation of trends.

Overall, this scatter plot serves as a powerful visual tool to explore the relationship between economic prosperity and hygiene access, highlighting the disparities and areas where further attention is needed to ensure universal access to sanitation facilities.
